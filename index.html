        <h1>SR Assembly - The Solar System and Space Exploration</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>n objects floating around space exploration is an incredible journey. By looking at the eight planets in our Solar System, we gain knowledge about their unique characteristics and their role in the vast universe.</p>
        
        <h2>The Planets</h2>
        <h3>Mercury: The Speedy Messenger</h3>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is named after the messenger god. It’s a small, rocky planet with extreme temperatures. During the day, it can get scorching hot, while at night, it becomes incredibly cold.</p>
        
        <h3>Venus: The Shining Morning Star</h3>
        <p>Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It’s often called Earth’s "sister planet" because it’s similar in size and composition. Scientists believe it might have once had conditions suitable for life.</p>
        
        <h3>Earth: Our Special Home</h3>
        <p>Earth has everything we need to live comfortably—the right temperature, water, air, and a great variety of living creatures.</p>
        
        <h3>Mars: The Red Planet</h3>
        <p>Mars gets its red color from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Scientists continue to explore Mars, searching for signs of past or present life.</p>
        
        <h3>Jupiter: The Giant Among Planets</h3>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, famous for its swirling clouds and the Great Red Spot—a massive storm larger than Earth.</p>
        
        <h3>Saturn: The Ringed Wonder</h3>
        <p>Saturn’s stunning rings, made of ice and rock, make it one of the most beautiful planets in our solar system.</p>
        
        <h3>Uranus and Neptune: The Ice Giants</h3>
        <p>Far from the Sun, Uranus and Neptune are composed mainly of ice and gas, giving them a striking blue color.</p>
        
        <h3>Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</h3>
        <p>Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Despite this change, it remains an important part of our solar system.</p>
        
        <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
        <p>From ancient astronomers studying the night sky to modern space missions, humanity has always been curious about space. In 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins embarked on the Apollo 11 mission, landing on the Moon and making history.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Space exploration continues to expand our knowledge and inspire future generations. As technology advances, who knows what incredible discoveries await us in the vast universe?</p>
